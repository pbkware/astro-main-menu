title: 'Running JavaScript functions'

This menu demonstrates:
* Running a JavaScript function when clicking a menu item
* Navigating to another URL using the `menuClickProcessor` click handler type.  This demonstration is more for test purposes as you would normally navigate with an Anchor tag (default).
